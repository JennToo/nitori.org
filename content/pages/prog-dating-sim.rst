Programming Language Dating Sim Concept
#######################################

:slug: prog-dating-sim

These are just some rough dumb ideas I have for a programming-language themed
dating sim.

**Setting**: Ada Lovelace Technical University

The Bachelors
=============

**Ruby**: Typical "cool guy" archetype, drives a motorcycle. But he's a bit
past his prime of "coolness"

**Python**: The vanilla character. Simple and straightforward, but not very
interesting. Think "plain oatmeal"

**C++**: Haunted by the character flaws of his father (**C**). Strives to avoid
those flaws, but is ultimately just like his father in all the ways he doesn't
want to be.

**Haskell**: Best friends with **Scala**. Very studious, often having deep
philosophical discussions. Takes himself too seriously.

**Scala**: Best friends with **Haskell**, but also a member of the **JVM
Fraternity**. He does very well in class, but isn't quite as bright as Haskell.

**Go**: TODO

**Rust**: Is very efficient, just like **C++**, but without the instability.
However, he's very full of himself. Very prideful, and envious of **C++**'s
social status.

Other Characters
================

**C**: Father of **C++**

**Java**, **Groovy**, **Kotlin**: Members of the **JVM Fraternity**

**Elixir**: Sells health potions?

**Dr. COBOL**: Old-timey professor who is way out of touch with modern life
