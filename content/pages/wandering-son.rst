**Nitori**, the main character of the series and namesake of this entire
website, is a trans girl. The story overall is an arc about her understanding
and coming to terms with her identity.

.. [1] Yes I know this isn't how the story ends, but I just refuse to
   acknowledge that. For the purposes of this page, this is how I will refer to
   Takatsuki. I think how the story deals with the end of Takatsuki's story is
   bad.
