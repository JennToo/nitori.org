:slug: projects

This is a random assortment of projects I've worked on in the past, or am
currently working, or currently maintain, or have maintained, etc.

**j2gbc: A Game Boy Color Emulator and ROM debugger written in Rust**

- `Writeup about the project <{filename}j2gbc.rst>`__
- `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Nitori-/j2gbc>`__

**WatchIt: An automatic script re-runner inspired by inotifytools**

- `GitHub repository with more information <https://github.com/ADTRAN/WatchIt>`__
- I wrote this for a hackathon, so the code quality isn't the best. But it works!

**altgo.us: A website for various transgender support groups and resources in Alabama**

- `Live website <https://altgo.us/>`__
- `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Nitori-/altgo-us>`__

**no-place-like-home: Automated Linux environment management**

- `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Nitori-/no-place-like-home>`__
- I use many different systems, so this is an automated way for me to keep all
  my settings in sync

**netconf_client: A Python NETCONF client**

- `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ADTRAN/netconf_client>`__
- I wrote this at work as an alternative to ncclient. We needed some more
  advanced capabilities for testing our internal NETCONF server, and there's
  also a long standing bug with ncclient and how it handles identityrefs
  (seriously who puts XML namespace refs within the text of an element? the
  IETF is who)

**Printables profile**

- `3D models listed on Printables <https://www.printables.com/social/117846-jenntoo/models>`__
- I enjoy 3D printing, and any models I publish I put on Printables
