<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>You can find a lot of the tools I use for programming via my repo
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JennToo/no-place-like-home">JennToo/no-place-like-home</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I use <strong>Ansible</strong> to automatically provision my own development environment, as
well as managing servers at home and at work. It's a very useful tool for
ensuring a consistent state across multiple machines. It also means I can
very quickly provision a new development environment.</li>
<li>My preferred text editor is <strong>Neovim</strong>. It's easy to use, even over SSH.<ul>
<li>And Neovim is way faster than <strong>Emacs</strong>. I used Emacs for about 12 years, but
eventually it got too slow and was really making my development time
inefficient. I do miss it sometimes, especially the Lisp elements.</li>
<li>Sometimes I will use <strong>VS Code</strong>, but I find it usually wants way too much
RAM and CPU for what it's doing. And I also prefer entirely keyboard driven
programs while programming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm proficient in a number of programming languages, but there are two that I
reach for the most often.<ul>
<li>I use <strong>Python</strong> by default. Most of my work doesn't require high runtime
efficiency. Since I'm usually developing tools and CI infrastructure, the
ability to glue disparate systems together quickly is my main priority. And
Python is great for that. üíñüêç</li>
<li>When I need resource efficiency, I'll use <strong>Rust</strong>. It works well on
embedded targets and for systems that need better performance than what
Python can offer. I wrote <a class="reference external" href="https://nitori.org/pages/j2gbc/">my Game Boy emulator</a> in
Rust.</li>
<li>I'm also proficient with these languages, but they're not my first choices
for new projects:<ul>
<li><strong>C++</strong> is fine, but not something I'll choose for a new project. The
language is a bit of a mess, with so many wrong ways to do something. The
tooling is also generally bad, except GDB which is great!</li>
<li>I admire <strong>C</strong> for its simplicity, but I wouldn't use it on anything
bigger than a toy project if I could help it.</li>
<li><strong>Groovy</strong> is not a good language at all. But since I write a lot of
Jenkins CI pipelines at work, that involves writing a lot of Groovy üò≠</li>
<li>Various <strong>Lisps</strong> are cool! Being <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic</a> is neat, especially when
combined with macros. I also think the model of &quot;live&quot; programming is
interesting, though I never really wrapped my head around it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For static website development I use <strong>Pelican</strong>. It's a <a class="reference external" href="https://getpelican.com/">Python based site
generator</a>. It turns Jinja templates and
Markdown / reStructuredText files and turns them into webpages.<ul>
<li>This website is made in Pelican!</li>
<li>I also use Pelican for maintaining <a class="reference external" href="https://altgo.us">the website for our support group</a>.</li>
<li>I'm a big fan of static websites with no backends, and very little
Javascript. I think most content on the web is served just fine by static
text on a page, laid out with some simple CSS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm also a fan of <a class="reference external" href="{filename}poetry.rst">poetry for Python dependency management</a>! Luckily, in the intervening time since I wrote that
blogpost the wider Python ecosystem really seemed to adopt poetry quite
heavily.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="home-services">
<h2>Home Services</h2>
<p>I don't like cloud-based and subscription-based online services. Where those
things can be avoided, I will do so. To that end I host a lot of services just
at my house on a server, which itself is just an old repurposed desktop
computer.</p>
<p>The files configuring most of my services can be found in my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JennToo/home-services">home-services
repository</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I use <strong>Jellyfin</strong> for hosting music and video content that I rip from disks
(physical-media4life!). It has an interface very similar to video streaming
services.<ul>
<li>For mobile access to music, I use <strong>Finamp</strong> to connect back to Jellyfin.
Its interface works very well on a phone, and looks more like a standard
music streaming system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For basic home automation I use <strong>Home Assistant</strong>. I don't have many IoT
devices, and to the capacity that I can I try and keep all of their network
traffic within my own network. I have a few smart switches that I use to
control fans and 3d printers, and that's about it. Home Assistant works great
for that. There's a lot of fancy things that it can do too that I've never
really explored. Maybe someday!</li>
<li><strong>Dokuwiki</strong> is a very simple wiki system where I keep my notes. It's a
little janky, but it works well enough.</li>
<li>I follow RSS feeds using <strong>FreshRSS</strong>. It works well enough. Not fancy at
all, just gets the job done.<ul>
<li>I think when Google killed off Google Reader that's when my disdain for
cloud hosted services really began üò°</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>nginx</strong> combined with some DNS records makes it easy to access all the
internal services by name. Instead of trying to remember port numbers for
everything.</li>
<li>All of the services I mentioned above are launched with <strong>Docker</strong>. Because
nobody has time to be trying to figure out how to install all the crazy
dependencies each of these services have üòÇ</li>
<li>For storage, I have a triplet of hard drives configured with <strong>ZFS</strong>. I like
ZFS a lot! In particular I like that it does frequent validation of the
stored data. It also makes backups to an external drive very easy.</li>
<li>I don't trust most of these services being exposed directly to the Internet,
so when I need to access things remotely I use <strong>Wireguard</strong> for VPN. It
works well once you have it setup. It's way easier to setup than OpenVPN.</li>
