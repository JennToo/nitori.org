<h1>My Favorite Books</h1>
<p>These are some of my favorite books! Not all of them are here, because there's
so many books that I've liked and I haven't taken the time to write anything
about all of them.</p>

<p>Written by Adrian Tchaikovsky, this is a very cool scifi series. The first
book, <em>Children of Time</em> is about the evolving life on a future colonized world
and what happens when they meet the remnants of human civilization. This is
definitely the best of the three. There's lots of great world building and some
very cool ideas about a different path that technology and civilization might
have taken if the environment where it evolved was different.</p>
<p>Note: avoid this series if you're afraid of spiders! I'm terribly afraid of
spiders and it was hard at times to get through the first book especially ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>The second book, <em>Children of Memory</em> is pretty good. Not quite as good as the
first, but close. It continues a lot of the same themes. The antagonist in this
one is genuinely terrifying to think about. I also learned a lot about
octopuses! And no, I'm not going to say octopi or octopodes; that's just silly.</p>
<p>The third book, <em>Children of Ruin</em> was just okay. It's a pretty substantial break
in plot layout from the first two books, and I didn't like it as much. It's a
much more contained story than the first two. It also has a very cliche ending
that was pretty obviously telegraphed early on. But it does still build on the
same universe as the first two books, and in that aspect it was still worth
reading.</p>
