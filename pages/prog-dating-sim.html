<h1>Programming Language Dating Sim Concept</h1>
<p>These are just some rough dumb ideas I have for a programming-language themed
dating sim.</p>
<p><strong>Setting</strong>: Ada Lovelace Technical University</p>
<div class="section" id="the-bachelors">
<h2>The Bachelors</h2>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong>: Typical &quot;cool guy&quot; archetype, drives a motorcycle. But he's a bit
past his prime of &quot;coolness&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong>: The vanilla character. Simple and straightforward, but not very
interesting. Think &quot;plain oatmeal&quot;</p>
<p><strong>C++</strong>: Haunted by the character flaws of his father (<strong>C</strong>). Strives to avoid
those flaws, but is ultimately just like his father in all the ways he doesn't
want to be.</p>
<p><strong>Haskell</strong>: Best friends with <strong>Scala</strong>. Very studious, often having deep
philosophical discussions. Takes himself too seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Scala</strong>: Best friends with <strong>Haskell</strong>, but also a member of the <strong>JVM
Fraternity</strong>. He does very well in class, but isn't quite as bright as Haskell.</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong>: TODO</p>
<p><strong>Rust</strong>: Is very efficient, just like <strong>C++</strong>, but without the instability.
However, he's very full of himself. Very prideful, and envious of <strong>C++</strong>'s
social status.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-characters">
<h2>Other Characters</h2>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Father of <strong>C++</strong></p>
<p><strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Groovy</strong>, <strong>Kotlin</strong>: Members of the <strong>JVM Fraternity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elixir</strong>: Sells health potions?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. COBOL</strong>: Old-timey professor who is way out of touch with modern life</p>
